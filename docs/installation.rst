A pre-compiled binary is provided for 64-bit x86 Linux systems under https://github.com/MikkelSchubert/adapterremoval/releases/

*************************
 Installing from sources
*************************

This section describes how to build and install the latest version of AdapterRemoval from sources.

Prerequisites
=============

Building and installing AdapterRemoval requires basic build tools including a C++17 capable compiler, meson_ v1.2+, ninja_, python_ 3.8+, libdeflate_ and isa-l_ v2.30+. Sphinx_ is additionally required to build the documentation.

On Debian based systems, these may be installed as follows:

.. code::

   sudo apt-get install build-essential meson ninja-build libdeflate-dev libisal-dev python3 python3-sphinx

On OSX, these can be installed using Homebrew as follows:

.. code::

   brew install llvm meson ninja isa-l libdeflate sphinx-doc

Building AdapterRemoval
=======================

To compile AdapterRemoval, first download and unpack the newest release from GitHub, and then run ``make``:

.. code::

   wget -O adapterremoval-3.0.0-alpha3.tar.gz https://github.com/MikkelSchubert/adapterremoval/archive/v3.0.0-alpha3.tar.gz
   tar xvzf adapterremoval-3.0.0-alpha3.tar.gz
   cd adapterremoval-3.0.0-alpha3
   make

The resulting ``adapterremoval3`` executable is located in the 'build/release' subdirectory, and can be run as-is. It is also possible to perform a system-wide installation of the AdapterRemoval executable, man-page, and examples using the following command:

.. code::

   sudo make install

**************************
 Building a static binary
**************************

A podman_/docker_ ``Containerfile`` is provided, which is used to generate the pre-compiled binaries mentioned above. To run this, meson_, ninja_, and either podman_ or docker_ are required.

To build the container, run

.. code::

   make static-container

Once the container has been built, run the actual build process via

.. code::

   make static

The resulting executable and extra files are saved to ``build/static/install``.
