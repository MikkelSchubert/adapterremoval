.TH "ADAPTERREMOVAL" "1" "Nov 01, 2022" "3.0.0" "AdapterRemoval"
.SH NAME
AdapterRemoval \- Fast short-read adapter trimming and processing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBadapterremoval3\fP [\fIoptions\fP\&...] \-\-file1 <\fIfilenames\fP> [\-\-file2 <\fIfilenames\fP>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBadapterremoval3\fP removes residual adapter sequences from single\-end (SE) or paired\-end (PE) FASTQ reads, optionally trimming Ns and low qualities bases and/or merging overlapping paired\-end mates into one read. Low quality reads are filtered based on the resulting length and the number of ambiguous nucleotides (\(aqN\(aq) present following trimming. These operations may be combined with simultaneous demultiplexing using 5\(aq barcode sequences. Alternatively, \fBadapterremoval3\fP may attempt to reconstruct a consensus adapter sequences from paired\-end data, in order to allow the identification of the adapter sequences originally used.

.sp
Output files for adapterremoval may be specified either via the \fB\-\-basename\fP option, which assigns default filenames, and/or via the individual \fB\-\-out\-*\fP to set or override the output filename for a given output read type.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-quality\-format name
The Phred quality scores encoding used in input reads \- either \(aq64\(aq for Phred+64 (Illumina 1.3+ and 1.5+) or \(aq33\(aq for Phred+33 (Illumina 1.8+). In addition, the value \(aqsolexa\(aq may be used to specify reads with Solexa encoded scores. The \(aqsam\(aq format may be used for Phred+33 data with very high quality scores. Default is 33.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-mate\-separator separator
Character separating the mate number (1 or 2) from the read name in FASTQ records. This is typically either \(aq/\(aq or \(aq.\(aq. By default AdapterRemoval will attempt to infer this separator automatically.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-interleaved\-input
Enable reading of interleaved FASTQ reads from the files specified with \fB\-\-file1\fP\&. Defaults to off.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP

Enables \fB\-\-interleaved\-input\fP and \fB\-\-interleaved\-output\fP\&. Defaults to off.
.UNINDENT
.SS Output compression options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-gzip
If set, all FASTQ files written by AdapterRemoval will be gzip compressed using the compression level specified using \fB\-\-gzip\-level\fP\&. If \fB\-\-basename\fP is used then the \(dq.gz\(dq extension added to files for which no filename was specified. Gzip compression may also be enabled by manually specifying a \(dq.gz\(dq extension for a output files. Defaults to off.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-gzip\-level level
Determines the compression level used when gzip\(aqing FASTQ files. Must be a value in the range 0 to 9, with 0 disabling compression and 9 being the best compression. For compression levels 4\-9, block based compression is performed using libdeflate. This may cause compatibility issues in rare cases, which can be migitated by using a lower compression level. Defaults to 6.
.UNINDENT
.SS FASTQ processing options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-adapter1 adapter
Adapter sequence expected to be found in mate 1 reads, specified in read direction. For a detailed description of how to provide the appropriate adapter sequences, see the \(dqAdapters\(dq section of the online documentation. Default is AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-adapter2 adapter
Adapter sequence expected to be found in mate 2 reads, specified in read direction. For a detailed description of how to provide the appropriate adapter sequences, see the \(dqAdapters\(dq section of the online documentation. Default is AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-adapter\-list filename
Read one or more adapter sequences from a table. The first two columns (separated by whitespace) of each line in the file are expected to correspond to values passed to \-\-adapter1 and \-\-adapter2. In single\-end mode, only column one is required. Lines starting with \(aq#\(aq are ignored. When multiple rows are found in the table, AdapterRemoval will try each adapter (pair), and select the best aligning adapters for each FASTQ read processed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-minadapteroverlap length
In single\-end mode, reads are only trimmed if the overlap between read and the adapter is at least X bases long, not counting ambiguous nucleotides (N). Defaults to 0.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-mm mismatchrate
The allowed fraction of mismatches allowed in the aligned region. If the value is less than 1, then the value is used directly. If \fB\(ga\-\-mismatchrate\fP is greater than 1, the rate is set to 1 / \fB\-\-mismatchrate\fP\&. The default setting is 3 when trimming adapters, corresponding to a maximum mismatch rate of 1/3, and 10 when using \fB\-\-identify\-adapters\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-shift n
To allow for missing bases in the 5\(aq end of the read, the program can let the alignment slip \fB\-\-shift\fP bases in the 5\(aq end. This corresponds to starting the alignment maximum \fB\-\-shift\fP nucleotides into read2 (for paired\-end) or the adapter (for single\-end). The default is 2.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-merge
In paired\-end mode, merge overlapping mates into a single and recalculate the quality scores. The overlap needs to be at least \fB\-\-merge\-threshold\fP nucleotides, with a maximum number of mismatches determined by \fB\-\-mm\fP\&. This option has no effect in single\-end mode.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-merge\-threshold length
The minimum overlap between mate 1 and mate 2 before the reads are merged into one, when collapsing paired\-end reads. Default is 11.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-prefix\-read1 X
Adds the specified prefix to read 1 names. Default to no prefix.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP

Adds the specified prefix to merged read names. Default to no prefix.
.UNINDENT
.SS Quality trimming options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-pre\-trim5p n [n]

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-pre\-trim3p n [n]
Trim the 3\(aq of reads by a fixed amount after demultiplexing but before removing adapters. See \fB\-\-pre\-trim5p\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-post\-trim5p n [n]
Trim the 5\(aq of reads by a fixed amount after removing adapters, but before carrying out quality based trimming. See \fB\-\-pre\-trim5p\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-post\-trim3p n [n]
Trim the 3\(aq of reads by a fixed amount after removing adapters, but before carrying out quality based trimming. See \fB\-\-pre\-trim5p\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-trim\-error\-rate rate
The threshold value used when performing trimming quality based trimming using the modified Mott\(aqs algorithm. A value of zero or less disables trimming; a value greater than one is assumed to be a Phred encoded error rate (e.g. 13 ~= 0.05). Default to 0.05.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-pre\-trim\-polyx nucleotides
Enable trimming of poly\-X tails prior to read alignment and adapter trimming. Zero or more nucleotides (A, C, G, T) may be specified. Zero or more nucleotides may be specified after the option seperated by spaces, with zero nucleotides corresponding to all of A, C, G, and T. Defaults to no trimming.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-post\-trim\-polyx nucleotides
Enable trimming of poly\-X tails after read alignment and adapter trimming/merging, but before trimming of low\-quality bases. Merged reads are not trimmed by this option (both ends are 5\(aq). See \fI\-\-pre\-trim\-polyx\fP\&. Off by default.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-preserve5p
If set, bases at the 5p will not be trimmed by \fB\-\-trimns\fP, \fB\-\-trimqualities\fP, and \fB\-\-trimwindows\fP\&. Merged reads will not be quality trimmed when this option is enabled due to the 3\(aq ends being located inside the reads or overlapping the 5\(aq of the source sequences.
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-maxns n
Discard reads containing more than \fB\-\-max\fP ambiguous bases (\(aqN\(aq) after trimming. Default is no maximum.
