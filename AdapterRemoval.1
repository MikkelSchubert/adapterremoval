.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBAdapterRemoval\fP [\fIoptions\fP…] –file1 <\fIfilenames\fP> [–file2 <\fIfilenames\fP>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBAdapterRemoval\fP removes residual adapter sequences from single\-end (SE) or paired\-end (PE) FASTQ reads, optionally trimming Ns and low qualities bases and/or collapsing overlapping paired\-end mates into one read. Low quality reads are filtered based on the resulting length and the number of ambigious nucleotides (‘N’) present following trimming. These operations may be combined with simultaneous demultiplexing using 5’ barcode sequences. Alternatively, \fBAdapterRemoval\fP may attempt to reconstruct a consensus adapter sequences from paired\-end data, in order to allow the identification of the adapter sequences originally used.

.TP
.B \-\-identify\-adapters
Attempt to build a consensus adapter sequence from fully overlapping pairs of paired\-end reads. The minimum overlap is controlled by \fB\-\-minalignmentlength\fP\&. The result will be compared with the values set using \fB\-\-adapter1\fP and \fB\-\-adapter2\fP\&. No trimming is performed in this mode. Default is off.

.TP
.B \-\-qualitybase base
The Phred quality scores encoding used in input reads \- either ‘64’ for Phred+64 (Illumina 1.3+ and 1.5+) or ‘33’ for Phred+33 (Illumina 1.8+). In addition, the value ‘solexa’ may be used to specify reads with Solexa encoded scores. Default is 33.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-qualitybase\-output base
The base of the quality score for reads written by AdapterRemoval \- either ‘64’ for Phred+64 (i.e., Illumina 1.3+ and 1.5+) or ‘33’ for Phred+33 (Illumina 1.8+). In addition, the value ‘solexa’ may be used to specify reads with Solexa encoded scores. However, note that quality scores are represented using Phred scores internally, and conversion to and from Solexa scores therefore result in a loss of information. The default corresponds to the value given for \fB\-\-qualitybase\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-qualitymax base
Specifies the maximum Phred score expected in input files, and used when writing output files. Possible values are 0 to 93 for Phred+33 encoded files, and 0 to 62 for Phred+64 encoded files. Defaults to 41.

.TP
.B \-\-adapter\-list filename
Read one or more adapter sequences from a table. The first two columns (separated by whitespace) of each line in the file are expected to correspond to values passed to –adapter1 and –adapter2. In single\-end mode, only column one is required. Lines starting with ‘#’ are ignored. When multiple rows are found in the table, AdapterRemoval will try each adapter (pair), and select the best aligning adapters for each FASTQ read processed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-minadapteroverlap length
In single\-end mode, reads are only trimmed if the overlap between read and the adapter is at least X bases long, not counting ambiguous nucleotides (N); this is independent of the \fB\-\-minalignmentlength\fP when using \fB\-\-collapse\fP, allowing a conservative selection of putative complete inserts in single\-end mode, while ensuring that all possible adapter contamination is trimmed. The default is 0.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-mm mismatchrate
The allowed fraction of mismatches allowed in the aligned region. If the value is less than 1, then the value is used directly. If \fB\(ga\-\-mismatchrate\fP is greater than 1, the rate is set to 1 / \fB\-\-mismatchrate\fP\&. The default setting is 3 when trimming adapters, corresponding to a maximum mismatch rate of 1/3, and 10 when using \fB\-\-identify\-adapters\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-shift n
To allow for missing bases in the 5’ end of the read, the program can let the alignment slip \fB\-\-shift\fP bases in the 5’ end. This corresponds to starting the alignment maximum \fB\-\-shift\fP nucleotides into read2 (for paired\-end) or the adapter (for single\-end). The default is 2.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-trim5p n [n]
Trim the 5’ of reads by a fixed amount after removing adapters, but before carrying out quality based trimming. Specify one value to trim mate 1 and mate 2 reads the same amount, or two values separated by a space to trim each mate different amounts. Off by default.
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-trimns
Trim consecutive Ns from the 5’ and 3’ termini. If quality trimming is also enabled (\fB\-\-trimqualities\fP), then stretches of mixed low\-quality bases and/or Ns are trimmed.
.UNINDENT

.B \-\-maxns n
Discard reads containing more than \fB\-\-max\fP ambiguous bases (‘N’) after trimming. Default is 1000.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-trimqualities
Trim consecutive stretches of low quality bases (threshold set by \fB\-\-minquality\fP) from the 5’ and 3’ termini. If trimming of Ns is also enabled (\fB\-\-trimns\fP), then stretches of mixed low\-quality bases and Ns are trimmed.
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B \-\-preserve5p
If set, bases at the 5p will not be trimmed by \fB\-\-trimns\fP, \fB\-\-trimqualities\fP, and \fB\-\-trimwindows\fP\&. Collapsed reads will not be quality trimmed when this option is enabled.

.TP
.B \-\-collapse
In paired\-end mode, merge overlapping mates into a single and recalculate the quality scores. In single\-end mode, attempt to identify templates for which the entire sequence is available. In both cases, complete “collapsed” reads are written with a ‘M_’ name prefix, and “collapsed” reads which are trimmed due to quality settings are written with a ‘MT_’ name prefix. The overlap needs to be at least \fB\-\-minalignmentlength\fP nucleotides, with a maximum number of mismatches determined by \fB\-\-mm\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-minalignmentlength length
The minimum overlap between mate 1 and mate 2 before the reads are collapsed into one, when collapsing paired\-end reads, or when attempting to identify complete template sequences in single\-end mode. Default is 11.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-seed seed
When collaping reads at positions where the two reads differ, and the quality of the bases are identical, AdapterRemoval will select a random base. This option specifies the seed used for the random number generator used by AdapterRemoval. This value is also written to the settings file. Note that setting the seed is not reliable in multithreaded mode, since the order of operations is non\-deterministic.

.SH WINDOW BASED QUALITY TRIMMING
.sp
As of v2.2.2, AdapterRemoval implements sliding window based approach to quality based base\-trimming inspired by \fBsickle\fP\&. If \fBwindow_size\fP is greater than or equal to 1, that number is used as the window size for all reads. If \fBwindow_size\fP is a number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, then that number is multiplied by the length of individual reads to determine the window size. If the window length is zero or is greater than the current read length, then the read length is used instead.
.sp
Reads are trimmed as follows for a given window size:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
The new 5’ is determined by locating the first window where both the average quality and the quality of the first base in the window is greater than \fB\-\-minquality\fP\&.
.IP 2. 3
The new 3’ is located by sliding the first window right, until the average quality becomes less than or equal to \fB\-\-minquality\fP\&. The new 3’ is placed at the last base in that window where the quality is greater than or equal to \fB\-\-minquality\fP\&.
.IP 3. 3
If no 5’ position could be determined, the read is discarded.
